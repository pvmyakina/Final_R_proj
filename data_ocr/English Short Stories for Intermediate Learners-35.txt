23. Cutting the Cable Cord
Over the years our cable TV subscription has become more of a burden than
enjoyment. We are not rich and have to count every dollar carefully that we
spend. One of the more unnecessary luxuries we treat ourselves to is cable
TV. Our kids love it and my husband is watching sports and news channels
all the time. However, our monthly bill is dangerously approaching the 200
dollar mark, something we no longer can ignore. Since no one in our family
is very familiar with modern technology I had to do some research myself.
Streaming TV via a so-called stick seems to do the trick. I convinced my
husband to buy a smart TV and a little device called Roku. Ever since, we
are all watching TV via streaming channels such as Sling, PlayStation Vue,
and others; we are saving a lot of money as a result. Of course, nothing in
life 1s free. We have to pay for the channels every month but they are still
much cheaper than cable TV. The bottom line is this rather new technology
is cheaper and we are also free from a constant bombardment of
advertising.
