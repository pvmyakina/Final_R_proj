31. Future Plans in Mexico
I am on vacation in Mexico and walking on the beach. I am staring at the
sea. My thoughts wander into the future. What will my future be like? What
I am supposed to do? I am dreaming of finishing my education with a
doctoral degree in medicine. Then I really could become a doctor and work
in a hospital. I could even have my own business. I also imagine becoming
a plastic surgeon. I know they make a lot of money and most have an
excellent reputation. Some of them even have become celebrities. My
thoughts wander further. I could also finish my education with honors and
then finish my life. But then again, I like where am I right now. Perhaps I
should just stay here in Mexico and spend my life in a hammock.
