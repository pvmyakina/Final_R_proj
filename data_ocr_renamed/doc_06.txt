18. Dialogue - Bicycle Paths In A European City
Last week I rode a bike to the university. There were two bicycle paths on
the road. On the opposite side was a young girl. She looked very beautiful.
She rode with me parallel in one direction.

Suddenly she stopped, and yelled at me: "You're driving on the wrong
side!"

We both stopped. She came closer. "Don't you know the traffic rules?" she
asked me.

I said, "I just wanted to save time."

She replied, "You don't save time if you hurt someone. An accident could
damage your bike. You could end up in the hospital! You have to take your
time. Accidents happen every day because people don't have time! Do you
want to get hurt as well?"

I then ask her, "Are you married?"
