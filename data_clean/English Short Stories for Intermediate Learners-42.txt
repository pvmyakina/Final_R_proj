30. A Clean House
Once a year, I need to clean the whole house thoroughly, This happens
usually in springtime when there is less moisture in the house. We are a
rather large family with four children, all of them teenagers, so the mess
and dirt are piling up quickly. Our house is a rather typical single-family
house with an attached garage and a small attic. The living room is openly
connected with the kitchen. We also have an extra freezer outside the house
where we store meat. Some of it comes from the hunting that my father
usually does on weekends. Anyway, when we start, we first clean the rooms
of the kids. We clean the floor and wipe the windows; we need to mop the
floor more than once until it shines and looks like new. I clean the furniture,
and usually, I need about half a day to get the kitchen clean. My brother
cleans the garage and helps to bring the trash out. We are a clean and
functioning family with a clean house and healthy children. We are
rightfully proud of ourselves.
