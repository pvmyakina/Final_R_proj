32. Dialogue - Dining European Style
Unlike in the US, in many European countries a customer can just enter a
restaurant and choose an available seat where you feel comfortable.
However, in more upscale restaurants most often there are no menus on the
table, so you would have to ask the waiter to bring you one. The waiters
usually wear a white shirt and black trousers. They also carry a little
notebook to notate orders.
Often a conversation between a customer and a waiter follows this pattern:
Waiter: "Good evening, have you already found something that you would
like to order?"
Customer: "I will take a schnitzel and a salad, number 5 on the menu."
Waiter: "That's okay. What would you like to drink?"
Customer: "Just mineral water."
Waiter: "With or without gas?"
Customer. "Still water, with little gas."
Waiter: "So you want a salad, a schnitzel and a mineral water with little gas,
correct?"
The customer nods.
After the meal, the customer asks: " Bill please."
A tip is always voluntary and in most countries is not included in the bill.
