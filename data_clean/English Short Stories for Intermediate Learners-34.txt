22. Alcoholics
Nowadays many people drink too much alcohol. Worldwide there are
millions of alcoholics. That is why many people die of alcohol-related
diseases such as cirrhosis. However, it seems everyone drinks alcohol in
one way or another. It is socially acceptable, so the question is: how
harmful can alcohol really be? Most doctors and experts agree that it is the
daily amount that makes the most difference. Too much alcohol can damage
many organs, especially the brain, the stomach, and the intestines. There are
also many reasons why someone can become an alcoholic. Psychologists
have found out that one of the main reasons someone grabs a bottle is
loneliness and frustration. Defeating addiction can be very difficult, but it is
also not impossible either. Most alcoholics can treat themselves by just
cutting the amount or stopping by changing their behavior, but a doctor can
also help with therapy. A special role can be played with the support of
friends and family as well.
