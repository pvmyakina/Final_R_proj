19. New Neighbors
Since I moved into a new apartment, I've also got new neighbors. A family
lives above us, and the children are still small. Sometimes I hear them play.
At night, the parents are seldom at home and the children often scream
strangely. A young man is living next to our apartment as well. He is a
student and lives alone, except he keeps a cat in his apartment. When we
meet in the stairwell he usually greets me. Next week we all have a so-
called tenants meeting where all the tenants of the apartment meet and talk
about common affairs. I'm looking forward to the meeting, as I will have
my say about what's right and wrong within this building.
