29. Grocery Shopping
My name is Fatima. I am originally from the Middle East; but I am living in
England where I have made myself quite comfortable, especially since I can
live here with my family. Grocery shopping is one of my daily needs.
Usually, I do this in the morning when fewer customers visit the
supermarkets. To save money, I always prepare a list. For instance, today I
need rice, vegetables, milk, sardines, and pasta. If I find cheap offers I buy
more of it. Potatoes and pork are not on my menus very often, as it's
something more for the British. In most supermarkets, you have to pack
your bags yourself and you can pay with your credit card.
