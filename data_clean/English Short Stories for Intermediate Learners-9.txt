Using this Book Effectively
For beginners it's probably more beneficial to glance through the story first and then read
aloud. Then review the key-vocabulary section and reread the story once more or until you get
a grasp of the story. Then carefully read the story at your own pace until you understand each
sentence. Vocabulary will be introduced to you at a reasonable pace, so you’re not overwhelmed
with difficult words all at once. Here, you won't have to look up every other word, but you can
simply enjoy the story and absorb new words simply from the story’s context. To learn English
effectively you just read each story at a time and study the vocabulary after reading. the English
presented in this book is British English, although some of the stories are based on American
English.
The English contained in this book is written using easy-to-understand grammar and
vocabulary that both, those at the beginner and intermediate levels can understand, appreciate,
and learn from. Some stories are focused on dialogue. These stories contain loads of natural
dialogue, so you can learn conversational English as you read. This is doubly beneficial as you
will improve your speaking ability as well. Over time, you will build an intuitive understanding
of how English functions. This differs from a more theoretical understanding put together via
learning rules and conceptual examples. It’s more important to reach to finish the story without
stopping than to understand every word. The simple truth is that you won’t get everything your
first time around. This is completely normal. Towards the end of this book you find the stories
slightly longer and more complex, but still comprehensible for beginners.
