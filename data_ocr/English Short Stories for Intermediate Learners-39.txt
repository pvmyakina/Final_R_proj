2/. The Big Move
We have planned to move to another city. Everything has been planned for
weeks, but this Friday we'll finally make the move. All our household items
have been packed in boxes, most of the furniture has been carefully
wrapped in blankets and foil. Additionally, we have made a list of which
items are in which boxes; this will help us to save time when we unpack our
stuff. It is difficult to make a move like this alone, which is why we have
asked friends to help us. We also leased a truck for that day. Since we are
doing everything ourselves, with a little help from friends and neighbors,
we are saving a lot of money. Professional moving companies are expensive
and we would rather save our money to buy additional furniture since the
new house is larger than the old one.
