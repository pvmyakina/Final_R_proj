26. To The Airport
Today begins my holiday and I will take a flight to visit my family. At
eleven o'clock a taxi picks me up to take me to the airport. The taxi ride
takes about one hour and will cost me around sixty dollars. After that, I still
have enough time until my flight departs. I have already packed my
suitcase. Packing is no child's game, with everything needing to be planned
and considered. If I forget something, I will probably have to buy it at some
expense at my destination.
It is already one minute before eleven and I am getting impatient. Finally,
the taxi arrives. The driver helps me to carry my suitcase from the house to
the car. I take the back seat and watch the meter charge me a dollar for
every hundred yards or so. Sometimes they offer fixed rates but not this
company; I think it's different in every city and state. Anyway, as we arrive
I give the driver a tip since he didn't take unnecessary detours.
