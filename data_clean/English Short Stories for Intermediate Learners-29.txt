17. The Experiment
At school, Sandra asks her classmates: "Is it true that old people smell
different?"
Her friend Gabi replies, “Well, they all smell rotten."
John laughs. "No, only the dead are rotten. Old people are not dead yet.
They are still alive."
Gabi chuckles. "All right. Then we will call them mature. But as a matter
of fact, I don't care how we call old people. I just don't want to be near
them. "
John raises his hand. "Wait a minute. I once saw an experiment on
YouTube. It shows that old people don't smell any different. Scientists let
three groups of people sleep in shirts: old, middle-aged, and young. Each
person had to sleep in the same shirt for five nights, and the shirts were not
washed. Then they asked volunteers to smell the shirts. The volunteers
didn't know which shirt came from what group, but all agreed and said that
the shirts of the old people smelled the best. "
"What kind of volunteers were these people who want to smell old people's
shirts?" asks Sandra.
John: "They were, of course, old retirees."
