3. Food Poisoning
My brother Marc feels terrible; he's been in bed since yesterday. He has
nausea, a headache, coughing, and diarrhea. He also feels exhausted. My
father drives my brother to the doctor. He explains the conditions to the
doctor and the doctor examines Marc. The doctor finds out that Marc has
food poisoning. It's a dangerous situation because Marc is already
dehydrated! The doctor also prescribes that Marc stay in bed and take
strong medication twice a day. My brother believes his food poisoning
comes from a kebab he had eaten the day before when he stopped
downtown.
