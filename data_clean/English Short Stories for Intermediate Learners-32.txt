20. The Funeral
Last week, my grandma died. The whole family is very sad. The funeral
will take place in the late afternoon, and perhaps some of the family will
join together for a dinner at a restaurant. By tradition, most of the dead are
buried but cremations are becoming more common, as some people think
it's more practical. When people go to a funeral they meet in the church
first. There everybody can see the coffin, nicely decorated with wreaths and
flowers. The pastor makes a speech about the life of the deceased. Then
everybody meets outside. The coffin is carried by the bearers to the tomb.
The family and friends follow the carriers and at the end, the coffin is
slowly dropped into a large hole. As a final goodbye, my parents and
siblings throw earth on the coffin.
