25. The Tourist Guide
Carlos was born and raised in Veracruz, Mexico, but he has been living in
New Jersey for over a decade. Since he had an accident and no one could
help take care of him; he decided to go back to his country and live there
with his family. Now he is a tour guide for American tourists in Cancun.
When the cruise ships come there are virtually thousands of English
speaking tourists who not only want to see the beaches and restaurants; but
are keen to explore the countryside and what the surrounding culture has to
offer. Carlos accepts group tours as well as individual tourists. He is quite
popular and made himself a name as a knowledgeable guide, who has
gained a small fan community on various online travel platforms. The tours
usually start early in the morning and last until late afternoon. Many tourists
wonder how Carlos speaks English without an accent. He tells them a little
about himself, but that usually leads to more private questions. Carlos is not
oblivious; for each question, he has prepared a perfect answer. This is
something he had learned in the US.
