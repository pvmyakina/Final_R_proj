33. Our Bicycle Tour
We are two young men on vacation in Holland. In this country, everyone
has a bicycle and it's part of their culture; that's why we rented a bicycle for
a whole week to explore not only big cities such as Amsterdam but also the
countryside. From the early morning to late at night we are riding our
bicycles and each day we try to cover longer distances. Normally we ride
about fifty kilometers per day. There are no mountains to speak of so we
can ride as fast as we can. Our bicycles are fully equipped, with head and
tail lights, gear shifts, a bell, and even an air pump. Besides those, we also
wear a helmet and a colored shirt. We'd like to think of ourselves as semi-
professional bicycle riders. For me, it is more of a sport, but my friend
already dreams of participating in the Tour de France.
