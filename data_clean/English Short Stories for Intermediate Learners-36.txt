24. Foreigners in Britain
In England, there are many landmarks for sightseeing trips and popular
tourist destinations in general. Probably the most visited cities by foreign
tourists are London, Brighton, Yorkshire, and probably Britain‘s most
visited sightseeing spot is the mysterious Stonehenge. Most foreign visitors
want to stay in London as there are hundreds of famous places to see.
Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, the Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus,
and the British Museum are probably even some of the most visited places
worldwide. London alone has over nineteen million visitors per year and
since the British Pound has fallen sharply over the last few years, the UK
will continue to be a very popular destination. The most common reason
why foreigners like Britain is probably its culture, for instance, tea time,
pub culture, and the Queen but also its history that seems to be everywhere
and connected to everything in their culture.
